#Cachengue

Because .NET was missing a good generic and reusable caching infrastructure

### What is Cachengue?

Cachengue has its roots in Argentina, you can say that cachengue is something funny or amusing near the limits of mariginality (eg: Cacho and myself when to a cachengue party). This word is also used when a quarrel or big argument happends between two or more persons. (eg: today at the office we had a big cachengue)

### But I'm a .NET developer who dislikes dancing and I'm really peaceful, what is, really, Cachengue?

Ok, ok, we get it. Well, you see, when you try to cache your data when you're developing an application and you have to rely on different caching solutions that all have their specific language that you have to use to talk to them and in the end adds unnecesary complexity to your code?. Well Cachengue is here to save the day.

Cachengue is a framework that uses the [ProviderModel](http://github.com/eallegretta/providermodel) and provides a single entry point to get a cache provider and use it, you can use as many different caching frameworks as providers exists, we've tried to cover the basics by providing an HttpContext provider, a Session provider, a Web provider, a Runtime provider a Memory provider and a Redis provider, but other caching frameworks exists and writing a provider is quite simple.
